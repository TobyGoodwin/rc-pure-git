Highlights of changes since rc-1.7. See ChangeLog for further details.

Portability. A fix to the autoconfiguration means that the nasty
longjmp() code is now omitted for all modern Unix systems; previously rc
only did the Right Thing on Linux. The test for large files in trip.rc
was removed, as this causes indigestion on file systems that don't
support sparse files (the configuration and implementation of large file
support is still present of course).

Bug fixes. Fix for CVE-2014-1936. Broken symlinks now glob correctly.
The variables $prompt and $version are now exported if they are
inherited from the environment when rc starts. EIO handling is now
enabled for readline too. A few bogosities in the history program were
fixed.

New features. Filename completion in GNU readline now quotes when
necessary.

Documentation. Minor updates only.
